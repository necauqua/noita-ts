# @noita-ts/nxml
A TypeScriptToLua package and type definitions for the
[luanxml](https://github.com/NathanSnail/luanxml) library.

Mostly useful only for Noita modding, as nxml is an unofficial name for
"an XML-like format used by Noita by having a badly non-compliant handwritten
XML parser full of quirks".
